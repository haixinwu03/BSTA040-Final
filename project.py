        **Time Series: Weekly Percent ILI in {full_state}**

        The line chart above displays the percentage of outpatient visits attributed to Influenza-Like Illness (ILI)
        in **{full_state}** over time (2010-2025). The x-axis, "Week Number," represents the number of weeks elapsed since the
        earliest data point for this state in the dataset (starting from week 0). The y-axis shows the ILI percentage.
        You can use the checkbox to toggle a 5-week rolling average, which helps to smooth out
        short-term fluctuations and highlight underlying seasonal trends in ILI activity.

        **Distribution: Weekly ILI % in {full_state}**

        The histogram shows the overall distribution of the weekly ILI percentages observed in **{full_state}**.
        The x-axis is the ILI percentage, and the y-axis ("Density") indicates how common different ranges of ILI percentages are
        (normalized so the total area is 1).
        The overlaid red curve is the probability density function (PDF) of an Exponential distribution that has been
        fitted to the ILI data. The parameter for this exponential distribution, $\\lambda$ (lambda), is estimated
        using the average of the observed weekly ILI percentages.

        **Why an Exponential Distribution? (Law of Large Numbers Connection)**

        The Law of Large Numbers (LLN) suggests that if we have many independent observations from the same underlying
        distribution, their sample average will be a good estimate of that distribution's true mean.
        For an Exponential distribution, the theoretical mean is $1/\\lambda$.
        By calculating the average of all observed weekly ILI values ($\overline{{y}}$) for **{full_state}**,
        we use this sample mean as an estimate for $1/\\lambda$. This allows us to estimate $\\lambda$ as
        $\\hat{{\\lambda}} = 1 / \overline{{y}}$.
        For **{full_state}**, the average weekly ILI is **{ili_value.mean():.2f}%**, leading to an estimated
        $\\hat{{\\lambda}} \\approx {lambda_hat:.2f}$.
        If the red curve (the estimated Exponential PDF) visually matches the shape of the histogram well,
        it suggests that an Exponential distribution might be a reasonable, albeit simple, model to characterize
        the typical occurrence of ILI percentages.

        * **What does this $\hat{{\lambda}}$ for {full_state} tell us?**
        
            A smaller $\hat{{\lambda}}$ (which means a larger average ILI %, $1/\hat{{\lambda}}$) would suggest that,
            for **{full_state}**, higher ILI percentages are generally more common, or that the distribution of ILI % has
            a "heavier tail" (more spread towards higher values).
            Conversely, a larger $\hat{{\lambda}}$ (smaller average ILI %) would imply that ILI percentages for **{full_state}**
            tend to be lower more consistently.
